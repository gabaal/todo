don't forget prisma:

1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Define models in the schema.prisma file.
3. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.
